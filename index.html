<h1> Early Career </h1>

<p> After a successful junior careeer with the Kamloops Blazers of the WHL that saw him win two memorial cups, Iginla was selected with the 11th overall selection in the 1995 NHL entry draft.  </p>

<p> He was selected by the Dallas Stars but never played for the organization, as he was traded to Calgary in a trade that involved hall of famer Joe Nieuwendyk</p>

<p> Iginla was successful during his first two seasons, but really broke out in year three, scoring 28 goals during the 1998-1999 season </p>

<h1> The Golden Years </h1>

<p> Iggy developed into one of the league's premier power forwards in the early 2000's. He scored 52 goals in 2001-2002, which earned him the Maurice "Rocket" Richard trophy as the league's leading scorer. </p>

<p> In 2004, Iginla led the Flames on an improbable run to the Stanley Cup Finlas, where they eventually lost in 7 games to the Tampa Bay Lightning. The series featured a controversial goal call in game six that may have won the cup for the Flames. </p>

<p> Iginla will always be remembered in that playoff run for turning in one of the most <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8PeKp6uAnM" target="blank"> memorable shifts in Flames history: </a> </p>

<br clear="all">

<h1 align="center"> Proud Son of Canada </h1>

<p> Jarome always represented his country well. He played for Team Canada in the Olympics three times, winning gold in 2002 and 2010. In 2010, Iggy asisted on the game winning goal of the Gold Medal Game </p>

<p> "The Golden Goal" occured when Sidney Crosby yelled his name, "Iggy" and Iginla slid a pass through to Crosby who scored. By any measure, it was one of the great Canadian sports moments of all time. </p>

<h1 align="center"> Forever a Flame </h1>

<p> Since retiring, Iggy has been elected to the hockey hall of fame, and been honoured by the Calgary Flames. He is my favourite athlete of all-time, and one of the greatest Canadians alive. </p>

<p> To be famous is to be known by your full name. To be iconic is to be known by just one. They don't make them like "Iggy" anymore, and they never will again. </p>
